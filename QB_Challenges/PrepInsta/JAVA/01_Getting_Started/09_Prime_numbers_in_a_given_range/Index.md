### Find the Prime Numbers in a Given Interval in Java  

- Given an integer input the objective is to check whether or not there are any Prime Numbers in the given interval or range. Therefore, we write a code to Find the Prime Numbers in a Given Interval in Java Language.  

```bash
Example
Input : 2 10
Output : 2 3 5 7
```  

- Method 1: my logic.  
> File Name : `PrimeNumsBetRangeMy.java`
- Method 2: ideal logic.
> File Name : `PrimeNumsBetRangeIdeal.java`

in both programs we can optimize the process when we shorten the for loop with Math.sqrt(end) or end/2.
