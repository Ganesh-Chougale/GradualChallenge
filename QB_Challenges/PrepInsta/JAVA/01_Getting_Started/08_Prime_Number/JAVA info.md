### Check Whether a Given Number is Prime or Not

- Given an integer input greater than 0. The objective is to Check Whether or Not the Number is a Prime. To do so we’ll write a code to Check Whether a Given Number is Prime or Not in Java that checks for the factors of the Number besides 1 and the number itself.

```bash
Example
Input : 23
Output : Prime
```

- Method 1: Simple iterative solution

- Method 2: Optimization by break condition
> File Name : `PrimeNumBreakOpt.java`
- Method 3: Optimization by n/2 iterations
> File Name : `PrimeNumHalfIteration.java`
- Method 4: Optimization by √n
> File Name : `PrimeNumOPT.java`
- Method 5: Optimization by skipping even iteration
> File Name : `PrimeNumSkipEven.java`
- Method 6: Basic Recursion technique
