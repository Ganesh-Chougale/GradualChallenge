### Find the Sum of First N Natural Numbers

- Given an integer input the objective is to write a code to Find the Sum of N Natural Numbers. To do so we simply keep adding the value of the iter variable using a for loop.

```bash
Example
Input : num = 5
Output : 15

Where first 8 number is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Sum of numbers = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
```
