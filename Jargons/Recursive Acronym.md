A **Recursive Acronym** is a type of acronym in which one of the letters in the acronym refers to the acronym itself. In other words, the first letter of the acronym stands for the acronym as a whole. 

For example:
- **YAML** stands for **"YAML Ain't Markup Language"**, where "YAML" itself is part of the expansion.
- Another example is **GNU**, which stands for **"GNU's Not Unix"**, where "GNU" refers to the acronym itself.

### Why is it called recursive?
It's called "recursive" because the acronym refers back to itself in its own definition, creating a sort of loop or self-reference.
